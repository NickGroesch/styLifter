## its a chrome extension! 

### but since its under development if you want to see how *groovily* its going:

1. git clone the folder

1. load it via the [instructions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/)

* navigate to `chrome://extensions`
* make sure dev mode is toggled on
* click 'Load Unpacked' button and select the folder you cloned

### now you can ...
* lift a sites css and capture an image of the viewport so you can 
* analyze and then save its palette
* visit the records you've made of sites
